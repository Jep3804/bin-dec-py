# bin-dec-py
Binary/Decimal Two-Way Converter


This is my first time dabbling with Python using the terminal, which seemed intimidating at first, but I got accustomed to it rather quickly. Anyways, this program takes user input througout, both as a means to progress but also parse the input and return the desired output. 

For example, when starting the program:

------------ THE BINARY DECIMAL TWO-WAY CONVERTER ----------------

Choose one of these 4 options:

Enter 1 for Binary-to-Decimal:
Enter 2 for Decimal-to-Binary:
Enter 3 for Ones' Complement of Binary String
Enter 4 for Two's Complement of Binary String

The user can type a number from 1-4 to use any facet of this converter. 
In each converter, the user types either a binary string (for Options 1, 3, and 4) or a decimal (Option 2) and the converter will do its mathematical and logical magic (more details in src/main.py) to convert the input into the output and return it. 

Feel free to play around, check if the conversions are correct, and if there any issues, don't hesitate to debug and fix!

cya later!
